Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification

1) Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed?
(We used Basenji_01.jpg as Dog_01.jpg.)

Answer:
Yes. All three models (ResNet, AlexNet, VGG) classified Basenji_01.jpg as “basenji”.

2) Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg?
(We used Basenji_02.jpg as Dog_02.jpg — the flipped copy.)

Answer:
Yes. For each model, the prediction for Basenji_01.jpg matched the prediction for Basenji_02.jpg (both “basenji”).

3) Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs?
(You uploaded Cat_01.jpg and Gecko_01.jpg; no separate object image was provided.)

Answer:
Yes. All three models correctly identified Cat_01.jpg and Gecko_01.jpg as “not-a-dog”.

4) Based upon your answers for questions 1–3 above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why.

Answer:
ResNet. All three models produced the same correct outcomes on this small set; ResNet is the best choice due to its strong accuracy with a faster runtime than VGG and generally better consistency than AlexNet.
